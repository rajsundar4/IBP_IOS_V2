 Switch the application to work with SUP Server, or directly with SAP NetWeaver Gateway or GWaaS.
 If you set the SUP mode to YES, make sure to perform the following:
 1. Add the ODP client libraries to the project.
 2. Uncomment all the relevant code for SUP connectivity (for more information, see the documentation).
 3. Set the following SUP connectivity settings: SUPHost, SUPPort, SUPDomain, SUPSecurityConfiguration and SUPAppID.
 4. Before making calls using the SDMConnectivityHelper class, use the appropriate Authenticating protocol implementation for user authentication (this will also configure the ODPUserManager correctly). Make sure to use the username and password parameters when initating the Authenticating protocol implementation.
 Note that setting SUP mode to YES will set the GWAAS mode to NO.
